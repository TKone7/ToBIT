					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A case study was conducted to get insights into the efficacy 
of error correction practice by using the automated writing evaluation 
system Writing Roadmap2.0 (WRM), on Chinese college students' English 
writing. In the research, a group of fresh students in Southwest 
Petroleum University were required to finish a title- and outline-given 
essay within 30 minutes by using WRM, and then to revise the essays 
according to the electronic feedback provided by the system in 15 
minutes. By comparing and analyzing the feedback reports given by the 
system, we found that the participants enjoyed better self-editing 
ability, writing accuracy and writing quality, but no distinct changes 
in the organization and ideas. The research indicated that students were
 able to revise their essays effectively according to the feedback 
information provided by WRM, but they needed more guidance and advice 
from teachers if they wanted to improve the structure, coherence and 
cohesion. This study offers new evidence to support the practice by 
using automated evaluation system on pedagogical grounds.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>While theoretical approaches to error correction vary in the 
second language acquisition (SLA) literature, most sources agree that 
such correction is useful and leads to learning. While some point out 
the relevance of the communicative context in which the correction takes
 place, others stress the value of consciousness-raising. Trying to 
reconcile the two approaches, this paper describes an application of 
artificial intelligence in the second language error remediation 
process. The software presented is called the Intelligent Tutor. It 
diagnoses some typical errors in the writing of university students who 
are learning English as a second language. A quasi-experimental study 
consisting of a grammaticality judgment pre-test, a treatment in the 
form of the Intelligent Tutor and a short answer post-test, was carried 
out with 266 university students in three countries. The findings show 
that artificial intelligence is an efficient instrument of error 
remediation, reducing the error rate by an average of 83%. This paper 
discusses the theoretical underpinnings of the software used, briefly 
describes the software itself and then presents the study design, its 
findings and their implications in the wider context of second language 
learning.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this article, we describe a deployed educational technology
 application: the Criterion Online Essay Evaluation Service, a web-based
 system that provides automated scoring and evaluation of student 
essays. Criterion has two complementary applications: (1) 
CritiqueWriting Analysis Tools, a suite of programs that detect errors 
in grammar, usage, and mechanics, that identify discourse elements in 
the essay, and that recognize potentially undesirable elements of style,
 and (2) e-rater version 2.0, an automated essay scoring system. 
Critique and e-rater provide students with feedback that is specific to 
their writing in order to help them improve their writing skills and is 
intended to be used under the instruction of a classroom teacher. Both 
applications employ natural language processing and machine learning 
techniques. All of these capabilities outperform baseline algorithms, 
and some of the tools agree with human judges in their evaluations as 
often as two judges agree with each other.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With the advent of English as a global language, the ability 
to write well in English across diverse settings and for different 
audiences has become an imperative in second language education 
programmes throughout the world. Yet the teaching of second language 
writing is often hindered by the great amount of time and skill needed 
to evaluate repeated drafts of student writing. Online Automated Writing
 Evaluation programmes have been developed as a way to meet this 
challenge, and the scoring engines driving such programmes have been 
analysed in a considerable array of psychometric studies. However, 
relatively little research has been conducted on how AWE is used in the 
classroom and the results achieved with such use. In this article, we 
analyse recent developments in automated writing evaluation, explain the
 bases on which AWE systems operate, synthesize research with these 
systems, and propose a multifaceted process/product research programme 
on the instructional use of AWE. We explore this emerging area of 
inquiry by proposing a range of potential questions, methodologies and 
analytical tools that can define such a research agenda.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>From 2012 to 2015, the online grammar program Grammarly® was 
claimed to complement writing center services by 1. increasing student 
access to writing support; and 2. addressing sentence-level issues, such
 as grammar. To test if Grammarly® could close these two gaps in writing
 center services, this article revisits the results of a Spring 2014 
study that compared Grammarly®'s comment cards to the written feedback 
of 10 asynchronous online consultants. The results showed that both 
Grammarly® and some consultants strayed from effective practices 
regarding limiting feedback, avoiding technical language, and providing 
accurate information about grammatical structure. However, the 
consultants' weaknesses could be addressed with enhanced or focused 
training, and their strengths allowed for important learning 
opportunities that enable student access to information across mediums 
and help students establish connections between their sentences and the 
larger whole. This article concludes that each writing center should 
consider their own way of closing these gaps and offers suggestions for 
multiple consultation genres, new services, and strategies for 
sentence-level concerns.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Grammatical error detection (GED) in nonnative writing 
requires systems to identify a wide range of errors in text written by 
language learners. Error detection as a purely supervised task can be 
challenging, as GED datasets are limited in size and the label 
distributions are highly imbalanced. Contextualized word representations
 offer a possible solution, as they can efﬁciently capture compositional
 information in language and can be optimized on large amounts of 
unsupervised data. In this paper, we perform a systematic comparison of 
ELMo, BERT and Flair embeddings (Peters et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 
2018; Akbik et al., 2018) on a range of public GED datasets, and propose
 an approach to effectively integrate such representations in current 
methods, achieving a new state of the art on GED. We further analyze the
 strengths and weaknesses of different contextual embeddings for the 
task at hand, and present detailed analyses of their impact on different
 types of errors.</td>

						<td>We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word 
representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use 
(e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across 
linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). Our word vectors are 
learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional 
language model (biLM), which is pretrained on a large text corpus. We 
show that these representations can be easily added to existing models 
and signiﬁcantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP
 problems, including question answering, textual entailment and 
sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing 
the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing 
downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A period of expanding globalization has emphasized the 
significant role played by the English language in both communications 
and information sourcing. In such an environment, it is understandable 
that many have sought to enhance available writing skills and the 
assessment of said writing skills. In recent decades, automated writing 
evaluation (AWE) has been applied with significant frequency to the 
evaluation and assessment of English writing performance in EFL 
environments. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact and 
effect of using AWE on EFL students' writing. In this study, the 
subjects were 57 EFL freshmen from the Department of Applied English at 
one university in the south of Taiwan. Both quantitative and qualitative
 research methods were used to conduct a quasi-experimental research by 
employing a t-test technique and a semi-structured interview technique, 
and the nonequivalent groups' pre-test/post-test control and comparison 
group design were applied to explore the overall effect of using AWE on 
the improvement of student writing in terms of accuracy, learner 
autonomy, and interaction. The research results reveal a significant 
difference between the experimental group and the control group in terms
 of writing accuracy following the adoption of AWE. Regarding the 
overall effect and the exploration of students' perceptions toward their
 usage of the AWE software, it shows that students who used AWE display 
obvious writing enhancement in terms of writing accuracy and learner 
autonomy awareness. The pedagogical implications of fully understanding 
students' usage of AWE in the writing process in order to improve EFL 
learners' writing performance are fully discussed.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>One of the criteria for excellent work is a perfect grammar in
 English, which is the global lingua franca. The Pangasinan State 
University subscribed to Grammarly® software which considered as one of 
the leading grammar checker and plagiarism tester software available. 
The objective of the paper is to evaluate the software based on the 
perception of the graduate students from the Graduate Students of PSU 
Open University Systems. The selection of participants is purposive 
where 20% of the total graduate students of the Batch 2018 who completed
 there thesis writing before graduation was selected as the respondents.
 A SUS questionnaire and follow up the interview as part of the 
triangulation method was used in order to determine the usability of the
 software, its strengths, and weakness. This study also focuses on the 
impact of the application for Non-English majors. Based on the result of
 the study, the majority of the respondents agree that the utilized 
software is usable. The users identified the strength of the software 
that helps the user improve writing such as automatic detection of 
mistakes in Conceptual Writing, Grammar, Punctuation, Sentence 
Structure, Style and Vocabulary Enhancement. While other users also 
identified some weakness for possible future improvement of the 
software, the overall result shows that there is a significant 
improvement in writing for English and non-English majors. Students who 
are not English majors showed that there is a significant change of 
confidence level in writing. It recommends that the software is 
continuously utilized. It is also recommended that the software should 
improve its detection to avoid misleading feedback for users.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article examines the strengths and weaknesses of emerging
 writing assessment technologies. Instead of providing a comprehensive 
review of each program, we take a deliberately selective approach using 
three key understandings about writing as a framework for analysis: 
writing is a socially situated activity; writing is functionally and 
formally diverse; and writing is a meaning-making activity that can be 
conveyed in multiple modalities. We conclude that the programs available
 today largely neglect the potential of emerging technologies to promote
 a broader vision of writing. Instead, they tend to align with the 
narrow view of writing dominant in a more recent era of testing and 
accountability, a view that is increasingly thrown into question. New 
technologies, we conclude, are for the most part being used to reinforce
 old practices. At a time when computer technology is increasingly 
looked to as a way to improve assessment, these findings have important 
implications.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>ABSTRACT This paper presents an empirical evaluation of 
automated writing evaluation (AWE) feedback used for L2 academic writing
 teaching and learning. It introduces the Intelligent Academic Discourse
 Evaluator (IADE), a new web-based AWE program that analyzes the 
introduction section to research articles and generates immediate, 
individualized, and discipline-specific feedback. The purpose of the 
study was to investigate the potential of IADE's feedback. A 
mixed-methods approach with a concurrent transformative strategy was 
employed. Quantitative data consisted of responses to Likert-scale, 
yes/no, and open-ended survey questions; automated and human scores for 
first and final drafts; and pre-/posttest scores. Qualitative data 
contained students' first and final drafts as well as transcripts of 
think-aloud protocols and Camtasia computer screen recordings, 
observations, and semistructured interviews. The findings indicate that 
IADE's colorcoded and numerical feedback possesses potential for 
facilitating language learning, a claim supported by evidence of focus 
on discourse form, noticing of negative evidence, improved rhetorical 
quality of writing, and increased learning gains.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The development of language processing technologies and 
statistical methods has enabled modern automated writing evaluation 
(AWE) systems to provide feedback on language and content in addition to
 an automated score. However, concerns have been raised with regard to 
the instructional and assessment value of AWE in writing classrooms. The
 findings from a few classroom-based studies concerning the impact of 
AWE on writing instruction and performance are largely inconclusive. 
Meanwhile, since research provides favorable evidence for the 
reliability of AWE corrective feedback, and that writing accuracy is 
both an important and frustrating issue, it is worthwhile to examine 
more specifically the impact of AWE corrective feedback on writing 
accuracy. Therefore, the study used mixed-methods to investigate how 
Criterion® affected writing instruction and performance. Results 
suggested that Criterion® has led to increased revisions, and that the 
corrective feedback from Criterion® helped improve accuracy from a rough
 to a final draft. The potential benefits were also confirmed by the 
instructors’ interviews. The students’ perspectives were mixed, but the 
extent to which the views vary may depend on the students’ language 
proficiency level and their instructors’ use and perspectives of AWE.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A major concern in today's world of pedagogy in general and 
language teaching, in particular, is the application of 
computer-assisted learning to improve students' achievement. There has 
been a long time that in the classroom setting only the teacher's 
feedback in a traditional way has been used in teaching. Due to the fact
 that this kind of notion can be traced back to a traditional attitude 
toward feedback, we looked for a new alternative in order to bring some 
innovation in an educational environment, namely Grammarly Software 
feedback provision. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to 
explore the impact of feedback provision by Grammarly Software and 
teachers on learning passive structures by EFL learners. Through 
convenience sampling, 70 intermediate male and female EFL learners were 
selected, then they were randomly assigned to two main groups: the 
experimental and control group. A grammar pre-test, a post-test, and a 
delayed post-test were administrated to the participants in six 
sessions. The results of the data gathered from pre-test and post-test 
reveal that the effect of teacher on learning passive structure, in 
pre-test and post-test, were more than the effect of Grammarly Software 
on learning passive structure of the learners, and the effect of 
Grammarly Software on learning passive structure in delayed post-test 
scores was more than the effect of teacher on learning passive structure
 of learners. The results might have implications for language teachers,
 learners, and materials developers.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Automated essay scoring is now an established capability used 
from elementary school through graduate school for purposes of 
instruction and assessment. Newer applications provide automated 
diagnostic feedback about student writing. Feedback includes errors in 
grammar, usage, and mechanics, comments about writing style, and 
evaluation of discourse structure. This paper reports on a system that 
evaluates a characteristic of lower quality essay writing style: 
repetitious word use. This capability is embedded in a commercial 
writing assessment application, CriterionSM. The system uses a 
machine-learning approach with word-based features to model repetitious 
word use in an essay. System performance well exceeds several baseline 
algorithms. Agreement between the system and a single human judge 
exceeds agreement between two human judges.</td>

						<td>Writing is a crucial skill in our society, which is regularly 
exerted by students across all disciplines. Automated essay scoring and 
automatic writing evaluation systems can support professors in the 
evaluation of written texts and, conversely, help students improving 
their writing. However, most of those systems fail to consider the 
context of the writing, such as the targeted audience and the genre. In 
this paper, we depict our vision towards new-generation AES systems that
 could evaluate written products while considering their specific 
context. In education, such tools could support students not only in 
adapting their written product to their particular context, but also in 
identifying points for improvement and situational settings where their 
writing is less proficient.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Automated writing evaluation (AWE) software uses artificial 
intelligence (AI) to score student essays and support revision. We 
studied how an AWE program called MY Access!® was used in eight middle 
schools in Southern California over a three-year period. Although many 
teachers and students considered automated scoring unreliable, and 
teachers’ use of AWE was limited by the desire to use conventional 
writing methods, use of the software still brought important benefits. 
Observations, interviews, and a survey indicated that using AWE 
simplified classroom management and increased students’ motivation to 
write and revise.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With the development of technology, any writer now can easily 
check their academic writing with automated writing evaluation program. 
Though, the utilization of this program may bring both benefits and 
drawbacks. Thus, a consideration of its strengths and weaknesses is 
needed. To fill the need, this study aimed to identify the strengths and
 weaknesses of Grammarly program as an automated writing evaluation 
program in evaluating academic writing. Using a narrative inquiry in 
exploring three Indonesian postgraduate students’ experiences by 
conducting interview and documentation, the result showed that this 
program has provided useful color-coded feedback with explanation and 
example, ease of account access, high rate of evaluation speed, and free
 service for evaluating academic writing. However, some caveats were 
also found in this program utilization, such as several misleading 
feedbacks, weaknesses on detecting the type of English and reference 
list, and lack of context and content evaluation experienced, which 
became the weaknesses of this program. Further investigation on the 
efficiency of the feedback given by Grammarly in improving students’ 
writing quality is needed.</td>
